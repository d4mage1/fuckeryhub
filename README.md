# Fuckery Hub
Yo, welcome to **Fuckery Hub**—a straight-up Roblox script that’s here to fuck shit up in Arsenal (or wherever you wanna run it). ESP for spotting enemies through walls and an aimbot that locks heads when you hold right-click. GUI’s got that neon glow, draggable and slick as hell. No bullshit, just hacks.

## What’s Inside
- **ESP**: Boxes on enemies only—red as fuck, works with Arsenal’s messy team system. Toggle it on, watch ‘em glow.
- **Aimbot**: Hold right-click, it snaps to heads and tries to fire if your tool’s set up right. Toggleable too.
- **GUI**: Draggable frame, neon borders, fade-in animations, and a close button that spins out. SciFi font for that futuristic drip.

## How to Use
1. Grab this script (you’re already here, dumbass).
2. Slap it into your favorite Roblox executor—Synapse, KRNL, whatever works.
3. Run it. GUI pops up in the middle of your screen.
4. Click **ESP: OFF** to turn it on—goes green, slides a bit, and enemies light up.
5. Click **AIMBOT: OFF** to flip it on—same deal, green means go.
6. Hold right-click for aimbot to lock and (maybe) shoot. Depends on the game’s remotes.
7. Hit the **X** to close it when you’re done fuckin’ around.

## Shit You Should Know
- **Game**: Built for Arsenal, but tweak the team checks if you’re runnin’ it somewhere else.
- **Fonts**: Uses `SciFi`—if it’s blank, your executor’s trippin’. Swap to `Code` or somethin’ if it’s broke.
- **Detection**: Roblox don’t play nice with this shit. Use at your own risk—I ain’t your babysitter.
- **Bugs**: ESP might miss a dude if Arsenal’s team system gets weird. Aimbot’s fire depends on remotes being named right (`Fire` or `Shoot`).

## Why This Exists
Cuz fuck playin’ fair, that’s why. Made it for the lulz and to flex some Lua. If you got ideas or fixes, fork it and hit me up.
