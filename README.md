# 🛠️ Fuckery Hub  
Fuckery Hub is a dope mod menu for Arsenal on Roblox, built by me, d4mage1. It’s packed with features like aimbot, ESP, and a suggestion system to send ideas straight to my Discord. Whether you’re tryna dominate, mess around, or just vibe, this menu’s got you covered. I made it clean and sleek with a ZYHPERION-style GUI, so it looks fire while you’re using it.

Why settle for basic when you can have some fuckery?

## 💡 Why Open-Source?  
Real shit—modding should be about learning and sharing, not gatekeeping. I’ve seen too many scripts locked behind paywalls or obfuscated to hell, and that ain’t the vibe. That’s why Fuckery Hub is open-source.

I’m putting my code out there so:  
✅ You can learn how exploits(LuaU) work  
✅ Experiment with your own ideas  
✅ Build on my work (just give me credits, yk)  
✅ Keep exploiting free for everyone  

If you wanna use my code, go for it—but give me a shoutout somewhere in your project. Let’s keep the modding scene collaborative and real. No paywalls, no bullshit, just good scripts.

## 📜 Can I Use This Code?  
Hell yeah, you can! But you gotta play fair. This project is under the **GPL-3.0 License**, so:  
- If you use my code, your project gotta be open-source too.  
- Give me credit (just say “Made using Fuckery Hub by d4mage1” or some shit).  
- Don’t be shady with it.  

Wanna collab or need help? Hit me up on Discord or wherever you can find me. Let’s make some fire scripts together, cuhh.

“Don’t steal my vibe, bro.”  
🎮 (Or do, but at least say my name, yk?)
